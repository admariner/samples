# Conventions

## General principles 
1. Keep it simple, if you don't need it now...lose it.
1. Don't repeat yourself.
1. Follow the conventions, but not at the expense of 1 and 2.
1. Treat these principles as rules. Break them only if you have a good reason.


## Linx 

- Names should be meaningful and descriptive.
- Names should be in PascalCase e.g. FirstName.
- Avoid abbreviations except for the ultra common ones e.g. XML is ok, NFT is not.


## Database

### Naming

| Type | Rule | Example
| --- | --- | ---
Column names | Singular and PascalCase | `FirstName`
Table names | Plural and PascalCase | `Customers`
Primary keys | Singular and PascalCase | `Id`
Foreign keys | [Singular of Table]Id | `CustomerId`

### Scripts 

Database scripts should be included under a `database` folder in the root of the repo.

```
[database]
    └── setup-script.sql
```

## Repository
The repo must include a readme.

The repo structure must be clear and descriptive e.g.

```
root
├── README.md
├── Solution.lsoz
├──[database]
|   ├─ setup-script.sql
|   └─ ...
├──[img]
|   ├─ screenshot.jpg
|   └─ ...
|──[ui]
|   ├─ js
|   ├─ html
|   └─ ...
└──[test]
    ├─ customers-source.csv
    |─ customers-target.csv
    └─ ...
```

## Readme
The readme should generally follow the format below.
- **Project name**
- **Description**. A short and clear description of why the project exists and what it does.
- **Installation**
- **Usage**
- **Contributing**. Explain how people can contribute to the project.
- **License**

Do not include a Table of Contents as it is automatically generated by Github.

See the [readme template](https://github.com/linx-software/template-repo/blob/main/README.md) for a good starting point.
