## What's Linx?

Linx is a low-code, general-purpose, back-end development tool.

Linx simplifies coding by abstracting many of the commonly used concepts and functionality in traditional coding with visual representations.

Linx Solutions are applications which have been developed and debugged in the [Linx Designer](https://linx.software/get-started-today/), which is a desktop based low-code, drag-and-drop IDE.

Applications are then deployed and hosted on a Linx Application server.

Some common use cases of Linx are:

- **Integration layer:**
Consume and host web services, process custom files locally and via FTP, multiple database drivers.

- **Automation:**
Perform automatic file transfers and imports, directory monitoring, script executions, API updates, batch file processing etc.

- **APIs:**
Build , extend and host REST & SOAP web services.
