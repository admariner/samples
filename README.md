## Samples overview

Repositories belonging to the [Linx sample library](https://github.com/linx-software) contain a single Linx Solution (`Solution.lsoz`) as well as any additional resources that are needed.

These Solutions fall into one of the below categories of functionality which are indicated as a 'topic' inside the particular repository (`[topic tag]`):

`[common-lib]` [**Common library**](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Alinx-software+common-lib) are small re-usable, user developed 'helper' functions which achieve a small specific task .

`[template]` [**Templates**](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Alinx-software+template) are generic pieces of functionality that achieve a complex task without integrating with a 3rd-party platform. These can be used within another Solution to achieve a more complex integration.

`[integration]` [**Integrations**](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Alinx-software+integration) demonstrate connecting to a 3rd-party platform in a generic manner. Typically, these consist of 'API Connector wrapper' functions which can then be used as part of a larger, more customized integration.

`[user-app]` [**User Apps**](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Alinx-software+user-app) shows off user's custom applications built with Linx.

Additional 'topics' are included in each repository to indicate more information about the type of functionality the sample contains.

## What's Linx?

Linx is a low-code, general-purpose, back-end development tool.

Linx simplifies coding by abstracting many of the commonly used concepts and functionality in traditional coding with visual representations.

Linx Solutions are applications which have been developed and debugged in the [Linx Designer](https://linx.software/get-started-today/), which is a desktop based low-code, drag-and-drop IDE.

Applications are then deployed and hosted on a Linx Application server.

Some common use cases of Linx are:

**Integration layer:**
Consume and host web services, process custom files locally and via FTP, multiple database drivers.

**Automation:**
Perform automatic file transfers and imports, directory monitoring, script executions, API updates, batch file processing etc.

**APIs:**
Build , extend and host REST & SOAP web services.
